# Number Guesser
Number Guesser - Turing Mod 1 FEE project (Hindreen and Katie)

Number Guesser is the second project in Mod 1 of the Front End Engineering program at the Turing School of Software and Design.

## Learning Goals
The Number Guesser lesson is designed to implement many JavaScript principles taught during the first three weeks at the Turing School. The lesson also builds on the Mod 0 and previous Mod 1 projects' CSS complexities, requiring our first significant adaptation for various screen sizes with media queries and flexbox. Number Guesser inherently requires proficient use of Git and GitHub to track feature changes.

The project's goal is to create the HTML, CSS and JavaScript files necessary to run a pre-designed two person guessing game. Various styling specifications and functional goals were set for the students, including comps for desktop and mobile layouts. The error message .svg image was the only asset provided for inclusion.

During gameplay, both players attempt to guess a secret number created by a random number generator. When neither guesses the number correctly, players receive feedback through hints that they were too high or too low. When one player guesses the current secret number, various elements within the document change to reflect the win. A 'card' appears on the right side of the screen to preserve the results of the game. At that time, a new secret number is generated and a new game can begin.

## Installation
Number Guesser requires no installation.

## Comps
Two comps were provided for students.
